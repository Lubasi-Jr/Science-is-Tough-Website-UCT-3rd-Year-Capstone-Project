# React Quiz App

This is a React application that simulates a quiz. The application retrieves quiz data from Supabase, allows users to answer questions, keeps track of the score, and shows the final result.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or later) - You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** (optional)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Run the following command:

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
```

Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning the project, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

or if you're using `yarn`:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables (for example, for Supabase credentials), create a `.env` file at the root of the project. Add the necessary keys to it, for example:

```bash
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_KEY=<your-supabase-key>
```

Make sure to replace `<your-supabase-url>` and `<your-supabase-key>` with your actual Supabase credentials.

### 5. Run the Application

Now, you're ready to start the development server. Run:

```bash
npm start
```

or with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn start
```

The app should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Tests

This project includes unit tests written with **Vitest**. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

or with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Building for Production

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized build of your application in the `build/` directory.

## Additional Information

- If you encounter issues running the app or tests, make sure Node.js and npm/yarn are up to date.
- For Supabase integration, ensure you have created a Supabase project and have the necessary credentials.
