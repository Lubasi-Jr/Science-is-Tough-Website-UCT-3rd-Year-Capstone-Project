- [ ] Change the title when user is on different page
- [ ] Better error handling
- [ ] Some animation
- [ ] Add typing to supabase json objects (convert to class object)
- [ ] Maybe cache recent activity?
- [ ] Maybe remove the challenge id from the quiz and add it to the junction table
- [ ] Check content table, that all the urls point to the right thing
- [ ] Should probably add a more info tag to click to expand the thing
- [ ] Name the quizzes table to questions table and the questions should be linked to a quiz table

This creates a table called challenge_quizzes with three columns: id, challenge_id, and quiz_id. The id column is an auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key for the table. The challenge_id and quiz_id columns are foreign keys that reference the id columns of the challenges and quizzes tables, respectively.

This type of table is called a "join table" or a "junction table". It's used to represent a many-to-many relationship between two other tables. In this case, the challenge_quizzes table represents the fact that a challenge can have many quizzes, and a quiz can be part of many challenges. By storing the relationship between challenges and quizzes in a separate table, you can easily query for all the quizzes associated with a particular challenge, or all the challenges associated with a particular quiz.
