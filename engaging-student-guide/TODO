This creates a table called challenge_quizzes with three columns: id, challenge_id, and quiz_id. The id column is an auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key for the table. The challenge_id and quiz_id columns are foreign keys that reference the id columns of the challenges and quizzes tables, respectively.

This type of table is called a "join table" or a "junction table". It's used to represent a many-to-many relationship between two other tables. In this case, the challenge_quizzes table represents the fact that a challenge can have many quizzes, and a quiz can be part of many challenges. By storing the relationship between challenges and quizzes in a separate table, you can easily query for all the quizzes associated with a particular challenge, or all the challenges associated with a particular quiz.
